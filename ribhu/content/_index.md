My name is Ribhu Ratnam. I've been writing code, reading code for the past 7 years. I like to build things that work. I also dabble in machining, robotics and chess.

I'm currently an engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Bengaluru, where I work on Physical Store products. Before that, I have interned at 5 different places.

All opinions are my own.
