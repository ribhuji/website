I am an engineer. Although my work title is Software Development Engineer, I believe I am not limited to engineering software only. 

I have worked on robots, CNC machines, PCB design to name a few. And I believe I can work on any field I would want to with some old-fashioned hard-work and a little help from the books in the nearby library.

I have done my undregrad in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Jabalpur. And am currently working at AWS.
